# Association for Computing Machinery at UMass Lowell
Welcome to the Association for Computing Machinery at UMass Lowell! <br/>

As a student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, our mission is to provide a platform for students to engage with the field of computer science outside of the classroom. <br/>

We focus on hands-on activities, lectures, and networking events in different subfields across computer science. <br/>

Whether you're new to Computer Science or an expert looking to share your knowledge in the field, we encourage you to attend our meetings! <br/>
